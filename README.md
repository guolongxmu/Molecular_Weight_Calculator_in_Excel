# Molecular_Weight_Calculator_in_Excell
This is a handy tool to calculate the molecular weight of chemical compounds from their formulas in Excel. It supports common elements and can handle complex molecules with ease.

Key Features
Input any chemical formula like H2O, C6H12O6, etc
use excel function CalcMass(),and automatically calculate the molecular weight
It also supports some abbreviations of organic functional groups, like Me, Et, Ph, etc
and can customize new functional groups by writing code of the python

Built-in database of relative atomic masses
Support for custom molecules and elements
Seamless integration with Excel
Call as user-defined function from cells
Input cell reference to read data
Output results back to Excel
Open source Python code for cross-platform use

Getting Started
The tool is implemented in Python for portability. To use:
